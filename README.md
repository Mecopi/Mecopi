# About me
    
Hi, my name is Benjamin, i'm 20.<br>
I'm  a self-taught developper since  12<br>
years now, i felt love about code when i was 8.<br>
I started by basics Web languages : HTML, CSS, PHP,<br>
then i got learned some strongers languages like C & C++.<br>
That was pretty much hard than web languages but was much fun<br>
too, so i kept going in this way, but you know, console applications..<br>
Therefore i discovered Visual Basic, yes, this language was really lazy but<br>
for the kid i was, this was a revolution, i was finally able to create<br>
some GUI interface, so, i did it for 2 years on VB, and i was happy<br>
about that, i discovered C# afterwards and i felt in love of this.<br>
I'm on C# from 6 years now, i guess, i continue to learn some<br>
other languages, but C# is still my favorite language ATM.<br>
I'm actually learning JavaScript now, so i understand<br>
a little much better why everybody say : 'LMAO,<br>
Javascript's drunk', yeah, he's really<br>
drunk but, it's fun because i keep<br>
learning, some new stuffs<br>
on programmation.<br>
