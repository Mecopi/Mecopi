Hi, i'm Benjamin Gamache, i'm 20, an hard worker self-taught who just felt in love of code when he was 8 at the start i was just codin for fun, try something. Contemplate what i did.. Aaand i do something else or do it again with another way. I need to underdstand what i'm doing, it's why i'm still coding.
If i want to something, i'll do something. That will works, don't mind how much time that'll take, but i'll reach my objectif.

I'm currently learning JavaScript, even i prefer compiled langages usually. But learning's everything great
I'm working on some little projects who just help me for doing borings tasks or just to challenge myself

I'd like to share some stuffs with community and obviously help every buddies who neeeds some help for anything
